It is said code is poetry.
Just as much poetry is a code!
Indeed poetry is the Code of Humanity...
The human code thus programs ideolojee.

We dance & sing  
  To express most everything.
We write and read  
  Thus knowing our deeds.

Humankind moves and thinks 
 with whatever be put in ink.
Books change the world 
 as hearts chase words.

Written code indexes, colors and fills;
design, screen and platform,
but psalter shall alter what it will
and always deem without quorum.

Ideas encoded in a language
Of the heart, wordless and timeless,
Aluded and indicated,
But incomprehensible and undefinable.

Yes, let it be said
That Code is a Poem.
Yet, let it be known
The Poem, too, is a Code.
