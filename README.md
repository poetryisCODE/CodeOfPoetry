# CodeOfPoetry

```
#1
It is said, "Code is poetry."
Just as much, poetry is code!
Indeed, poetry is the code of humanity;
The human code thus programs ideology.

# 2
We dance & sing
To express most everything.
We write and read
Thus knowing our deeds.

# 3
Humankind moves and thinks
With whatever be put in ink.
Books change worlds
As hearts chase words.

# 4
Written code indexes, colors & fills
Design, screen & platform,
But psalter shall alter what wills
And always deem without quorum.

# 5
Ideas encoded in a language
Of the heart, wordless and timeless,
Aluded and indicated,
But incomprehensible and undefinable.

# 6
Yes, let it be said
that code is a poem.
Yet, let it be known
the poem, too, is a code.
